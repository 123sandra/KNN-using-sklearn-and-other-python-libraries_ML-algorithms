# KNN-using-sklearn-and-other-python-libraries_ML-algorithms
Practiced K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) for prediction with the help of python libraries like pandas,sklearn,matplotlib,seaborn etc. Got an accuracy of 91.39% during training and testing. created a confusion matrix to understand the True positive, True negative, False positive and False negative. Tested the developed model using a new values.
